# Encryption engine #
# --------------------- #

In the encryption engine you can encrypt your input code to...
1. Caesar cipher
2. Fence cipher
3. AtBsh cipher
4. Random cipher

# Explain about the encryption #
## 🔴Caesar cipher🔴 ##
The software get user input and a number,  
The software returns the code in a skip according to the user's choice.

## 🔴Fence cipher 🔴##
The software get user input,  
the software returns the code in order of...  
first the even characters and after the odd characters.

## 🔴AtBsh cipher🔴 ##
The software get user input,  
the software returns the code in the opposite order.

## 🔴Random cipher🔴 ##
The software get user input,  
the software returns random letters and numbers


# To run the software #
in the **main.py** you need to run the function called **main()**
