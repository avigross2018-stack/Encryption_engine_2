# Encryption engine #

In the encryption engine you can encrypt your input code to...
1. Caesar cipher
2. Fence cipher
3. AtBsh cipher
4. Random cipher

# Explain about the encryption #
+## Caesar cipher ##
The software get user input and a number,  
The software returns the code in a skip according to the user's choice.

+## Fence cipher ##
The software get user input,  
the software returns the code in order of...  
first the even characters and after the odd characters.

+## AtBsh cipher ##
The software get user input,  
the software returns the code in the opposite order.

+## Random cipher ##
The software get user input,  
the software returns random letters and numbers


# To run the software #
in the **main.py** you need to run the function called **main()**
